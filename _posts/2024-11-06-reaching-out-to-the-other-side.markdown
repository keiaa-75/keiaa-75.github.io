I’d like you to imagine this; Bonifacio Global City. Stunning, right? Bustling metropolis, full of staggering skyscrapers, the place of innovation. Not too far, we’d stumble upon the likes of Tondo, Batasan, Payatas, and Bagong Silang. You surely won’t expect there to be slums, characterized by stagnancy and poverty — rather shocking differences. Even West Rembo, that’s just three kilometers away! This is similar to how digital divide is — a social injustice. Hundreds of people, disconnected. Countless hopes, crushed. 
This is the glimpse for the remaining 1 billion people without any device to use, and 2.6 billion people around the world without internet access. Hoping, dreaming that they could someday reach out to the other side. I am Jilrosh Abarte and I’ll be with you today to look at this unfortunate reality in our modern society.

As the day breaks in the city, people rush through the narrow alleyways to head towards the nearest computer shop, or pisonet, as we call it. The cramped, dimly lit space hums with old computers and sighs as they wait for their turn. After dropping the tattered peso coin in the slot, their hands swiftly navigate with the mouse, minds racing even faster. Every click, every keypress, important. It’s a race against time. “Timeout! Damn it. I’m not done… yet!”

Moving deeper in the city, we encounter the Mundane Corporation. Thousands, if not hundreds of people are lined up for the job application. “Thank you, we’ll update you on call for your application.”  Call… more like bumped to a wall. They’re looking for someone with digital skills and experience in their resume. It just so happens, there’s none on yours. You walk away while murmuring after you see the next nerdy looking guy with his glasses and laptop happily welcomed over. “I mean, how am I supposed to finish the race if I’m chained to the starting line.”

In the office, a commotion ensues. The IT department thought they were supposed to handle serious trouble, turns out not. “Uhh, excuse me? How do I send this email, it won’t work… Where’s the web browser? How do I do this? I can’t figure it out.” The lads from the department are on, back and forth! Walking to cubicles, responding to a call after another, and fixing that one ‘spoiled’ printer. Heaven's goodness, they sure didn’t expect they’re gonna be like teachers here! “We seriously thought high school already dealt with this man.”

The night eventually falls and we’re back to rush hours. You know Philippines, not a day on the Metro roads you’d see a vehicle cruising at 30 kilometers per hour. Inside the low-lit, packed jeepneys are the heartbreaking sight of worried parents. “I’m late to go home again. I wonder how my kids are. I hope they’re safe and fine… I can’t call them, I have no load anymore. How long will this be?” Back at home, the children wait for their parents just so they can see the assignment their teacher gave online. 

How long will they, we be stuck waiting? In BGC, you have the flashiest devices and fastest internet access in the country. If in places like that they don’t have to deal with this, then why do we have to? Why should access to the information we desperately need remain a privilege, not a right? 

After seeing those stark realities, I now want you to visualize this future. A future where technology empowers young minds, aspiring people, and small businesses alike. Where everyone has an equal opportunity in this digital world. Where the IT guys don’t have to come over to fix even every tiniest of things or even the ‘stupid’ printer. A tomorrow where we connect people. Access not only to information, but digital technology is my right, your right, everyone’s right, and what’s right. I stand before you today, not as a speaker, but as a voice for billions who remain unheard. Together, we can build a bridge, not of bricks, but of action and compassion. Dream on, act on. Let’s reach the other side.
