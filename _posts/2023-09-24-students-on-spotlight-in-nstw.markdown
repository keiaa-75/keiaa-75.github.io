Filipino students across the country successfully stunned the public as they unveiled their inventions in the National Science and Technology Week at the World Trade Center in Pasay City, last November 27, 2022.

The event spearheaded by the Department of Science and Technology, with the theme “Agham at Teknolohiya: Kabalikat sa Maunlad at Matatag na Kinabukasan,” aims to showcase recent research and development (R&D) from DOST agencies, regional offices, and institutional affiliates that bolstered the country’s efforts to solve the challenges brought about by the Coronavirus pandemic and climate change.

## Microplastics: Small but terrible

Amongst the innovative outputs shown in the exhibit is from David Atup of Philippine Science High School - Central Visayas, who created a device that can detect microplastics or tiny plastic fragments no less than 5 mm that are extremely harmful for our health and environment.

These microplastics that have already been found in the Arctic, Antarctic, and deep sea floor pose a serious and significant threat to aquatic life as they can cause damage to body tissues, inflammation, infection, reduced appetite, stunted growth, and reproductive failure upon ingestion according to the United States National Institutes of Health.

Their presence in our country’s waters would lead to accumulation of pollutants, disruption of the food chain and may lead to the potential collapse of the entire ecosystem in an area that would drastically affect our aquacultural sector that relies on such resources, and possibly affect the health of people that may consume those.

## Eco-friendly acceleration

Moreover, the Cagayan State University also captured the attention of President Marcos with their electric-powered vehicles, such as their C-trike (or converted tricycle) and electric boat that focuses on providing an environment-friendly means of transportation for the public while cutting down on costs at the same time.

In line with the study of the Alternative Data Fuels Center, these vehicles are more energy-efficient than gasoline-powered vehicles thus costing less to operate, while cutting down on greenhouse gasses and tailpipe emissions in comparison with traditional vehicles, which help to reduce their environmental impact.

Although initial purchases of EV’s are comparably expensive against their same-tier counterparts, EV owners can save money in the long run due to lower operating costs, tax incentives (depending on a country’s program), and cheaper maintenance that would otherwise be off limits to traditional vehicles.

Electric vehicles, as much of a deviation as they can be from gas dependence, don’t lack in performance either as they tend to provide instant torque (rotation of the wheels), thus providing faster and smoother acceleration improved by their stability due to a lower center of gravity, which is demonstrated best by the Tesla Model Y which can floor a 0-100 km/h in 5 seconds in the base powertrain version which is snappier in comparison to Toyota Corolla E210’s 10.2s (1.6L VVT-i), Honda Civic FE’s 7.3s (1.5L RS), Hyundai Elantra CN7’s 11.6s, and 2019 Chevrolet Impala LS’ 6.1s (3.6L V6).

## Green waves

According to Omega Grey and Green Boat Solutions, two German companies that specialize in the electric boat industry, since such boats are not powered by gasoline motors, they are affordable in terms of operation and maintenance, similar to the previously mentioned EVs.

Most importantly, they are quieter and do not produce harmful emissions that would otherwise be disruptive to marine wildlife which in turn would provide more and better opportunities for fishermen to catch fish to ensure higher yields.

The reliance on electricity, albeit making them weaker in comparison to piston engines, would ensure that oil leaks are a thing of the past, which is a highly beneficial factor for our fishing sector that suffers drastically from such instances, like the sinking of MT Princess Empress last February 28 that pegged around ₱3.8B in losses.

On the other hand, the week-long national science celebration is now held every fourth week of November from the previous third week of July, after former President Duterte issued Proclamation 780 to ensure maximum participation of organizational affiliates and educational institutions, along with their constituents due to a major shift in their academic calendars.

The Department of Science and Technology later added that they are actively promoting and encouraging students to explore the field of science as they continue to strengthen their efforts to support local government units in successfully applying and integrating technology to multiple sectors, in order to build smart and sustainable communities.

Impressed by these scientific ventures, President Bongbong promises that support for our homegrown scientists will continue and prevail as their skills and knowledge are greatly beneficial and necessary to improve the lives of the Filipinos as we hope for their inventions to be successfully commercialized before they take the stage once again next year.
