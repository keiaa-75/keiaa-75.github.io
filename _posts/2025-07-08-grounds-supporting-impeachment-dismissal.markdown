## Statement of facts
 
In December 2024, three impeachment complaints were filed against Vice President Duterte in the House. These complaints were accepted by House Secretary General Reginald Velasco, but deliberately not referred immediately to the Committee on Justice. He admitted that he was acting upon instructions to hold said three complaints to give the House Majority more time to coordinate for a one-third complaint. Eventually, this Fourth Impeachement Complaint was filed on February 5. This time, it was signed by 215 members of the Chamber, which invoked the Rule IV of the House Rules of Procedure in Impeachment Proceedings.
 
> A verified complaint/resolution of impeachment filed by at least one‑third (1/3) of all the Members of the House shall constitute the Articles of Impeachment, and in this case the verified complaint/resolution shall be endorsed to the Senate in the same manner as an approved bill of the House. The complaint/resolution must, at the time of filing, be verified and sworn to before the Secretary General by each of the Members constituting at least one‑third (1/3) of all Members of the House...
 
## Conflict involving the House Secretary General
 
The Constitution, under the Article XI, Section 3(5) says;
 
> No impeachment proceedings shall be initiated against the same official more than once within a period of one year.
 
The defense of VP Duterte's camp primarily cites this as the center of her defense when she filed for a Petition for Certiorari, under the pretense that the first complaint filed on 2nd of December invoked this one-year bar. However, this is clearly refuted by *Francisco v. House of Representatives*, G.R. No. 160261 (Nov. 10, 2003).
 
> Having concluded that the initiation takes place by the act of filing and referral or endorsement of the impeachment complaint to the House Committee on Justice or, by the filing by at least one‑third of the members of the House of Representatives with the Secretary General of the House, the meaning of Section 3(5) of Article XI becomes clear. Once an impeachment complaint has been initiated, another impeachment complaint may not be filed against the same official within a one year period.
 
Therefore, none of the three complaints can ever be considered initiated. Regardless, the Secretary General's refusal to refer the complaints immediately to the House Speaker should be rendered as *mala fide* under these arguments:
 
- It constitutes a breach of the Rule II, Section 3 of the House Rules of Procedure in Impeachment Proceedings.
- It served to prejudice the Vice President by leaving unresolved complaints hanging in the public sphere, thereby harming her reputation.
- It represents an act of political gamesmanship that undermines the sanctity of impeachment proceedings and violates the spirit of the Constitution.
 
Under the liberal reading in *Francisco v. House*, the impeachment process must be respected to uphold constitutional safeguards. The House should not arbitrarily withhold referral to circumvent the one-year bar. Doing so amounts to a manipulation of the constitutional process — effectively a fraud upon the Constitution and, by extension, an affront to the Nation itself.
 
## Conflict with the House members
 
While Article XI, Section 3(4) of the Constitution allows the impeachment process to bypass the Committee on Justice if at least one-third of all House Members endorse the complaint, this mechanism presumes that such endorsements are genuine, voluntary, and made with a full understanding of the charges — not merely products of political expediency. On this point, the House again falls short.
 
Notably, shortly after the complaint was filed, Cebu’s 5th District Representative Duke Frasco openly admitted that his decision to sign was primarily out of deference to the Speaker’s leadership, concern for the continuity of infrastructure funding in his district should he decline to align with the majority, and owing to a personal rift involving the Vice President and his wife. This is further underscored by the subsequent action of his own party, the National Unity Party, which expelled Congressman Frasco on 8th of June after he declined to sign the manifesto affirming support for the continued speakership of Congressman Martin Romualdez.
 
This suggests that certain signatures may have been obtained under political duress, rather than through a sincere assessment of the alleged offenses of the Vice President. It is further notable that the fourth complaint materialized only after three earlier complaints were inexplicably withheld from referral, despite having been accepted in proper form by Congressman Velasco. Taken together, these circumstances point to a possible orchestrated effort aimed at the political persecution of the Vice President within that intervening month.
 
## Disposition sought
 
The impeachment process exists as a constitutional safeguard to ensure accountability, not as a political weapon or a mere contest of numbers. A complaint founded on undue influence, shallow political alignments, or purely partisan motives constitutes an abuse of this mechanism and renders the proceeding void. This position paper does not purport to advance the interests of any party directly concerned. It asserts, however, that the Fourth Impeachment Complaint is *mala fide*, improperly initiated, and falls short of the constitutional standard required for such a grave undertaking.
 
Accordingly, we respectfully seek that the Senate should declare the complaint *void ab initio* and dismiss it outright, thereby preserving the integrity of the constitutional design. We further suggest that any subsequent attempt to hold the Vice President to account be pursued through alternative procedural avenues within the year.
