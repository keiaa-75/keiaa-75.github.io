<sup>A sign for a flood control project in Caloocan City partially submerged during heavy rains.</sup>

We Filipinos just really seem to love plastics, don't we? We produce about 2.7 million tons of plastic waste every year, most likely from 164 million sachets and 48 million plastic bags we use daily. Alarmingly, roughly 20% of these pollute our ocean and largely comprises the garbage that has since been a problem for 70% of Metro Manila's drainage systems. [^footnote] [^fn-nth-2]

As the rainy season rolls in, the consequences and karma upon us becomes painfully evident. In this July alone, downpours turned parts of the Metro into murky ponds. Roads no longer passable, knee-deep flood seeping into various establishments, and the ever-so controversial romanticization of the Filipino resiliency. [^fn-nth-3]

In our vernacular, calling someone *plastik* means they are fake. Friendly when convenient, hollow when the time comes. The tarps we've used to see, made of literal plastic, represent the very promises we Filipinos are tired of. Seemingly bright and durable, but disturbingly disposable. We're tired of this, so why stick with *trapos*? I mean, tarpos.

For years, national and local governments have boasted of flood control budgets, padded reports, and ribbon-cutting ceremonies that go nowhere. Many drainage projects are funded, roads are dug up, canals are cemented over, and then nothing. The next rain comes and we're right back where we started; knee-deep in both water and excuses. Billions have been allocated through annual budgets, yet we’re still counting flood days instead of improvements.

Which is why it's almost laughable, if not entirely frustrating, to hear that the Head of the Nation is only now expressing dismay that officials prioritized putting up tarpaulins ahead of the upcoming State of the Nation Address. [^fn-nth-4] As if this were a misstep, not the norm. Are we to believe they acted independently, without any cue from above? Well, credit where it’s due. They had initiative, if so. But does the leadership?

In a nation drowning in plastic, perhaps the greatest pollutant we face isn't only present in our waterways. It's the *plastik* mentality that governs from above, yet refuses to clean up after itself.
