Hi, I'm Keiaa!

You might also know me as nozomi-75, Mundagenta, or by my real name, Jill Abarte. I'm a Filipino high school student with a passion for technology, open source, and creative problem-solving.

I'm an avid Linux user and a practicing system administrator, often found scripting, building web projects, or developing in Java. I enjoy beta testing software and volunteering in help threads, especially those related to Linux, where I love assisting others and sharing what I've learned.

Beyond code, I'm a campus journalist and a novice UI/UX designer, always eager to explore the intersection of technology and storytelling. Whether it's refining user experiences or writing about the latest in tech, I strive to make a positive impact in every community I'm part of.

Thanks for stopping by!
