<sup>In the dim light, Kana leans forward as her crimson eyes meets yours with a knowing smile.</sup>

Hi, I'm **Keiaa**! You might also know me as **nozomi-75**, Mundagenta, or by my real name, **Jill Abarte**. I'm a Filipino high school student with a passion for technology, open source, and creative problem-solving.

## What do you do?

I'm an avid **Linux user** and a **practicing system administrator**, often found scripting, building web projects, or developing in Java. I enjoy beta testing software and volunteering in help threads, especially those related to Linux, where I love assisting others and sharing what I've learned.

Beyond code, I'm a **campus journalist** and a **novice UI/UX designer**. I'm always eager to explore the intersection of technology and storytelling. Whether it's refining user experiences or writing about the latest in tech, I strive to make a positive impact in every community I'm part of.

## What do you advocate for?

I am a person of many things, and so, I have a lot to advocate and speak strongly about. Here are some of them, before I bore you with all these:

- Advancing accessible, inclusive, and high-quality basic education for learners from all walks of life, in my country and across the world.
- Protecting and promoting digital privacy and security as fundamental rights for every individual.
- Bridging the digital divide to ensure that inclusive and equitable development benefits all communities.
- Advancing the use and development of free and open-source software as a pathway to shared knowledge and innovation.
- Upholding consumers’ rights and their rightful control over the products they purchase and use.

## What are you outside of those things?

You’ll often find me tinkering with projects tied to my advocacies, but I’m not all work. When the repetitive or technical tasks start to wear me down, I turn to photography and image processing whenever I get the chance. My favorite subjects are people, landscapes, and nature, and I always try to capture the essence of a moment. The atmosphere, the feeling, the here and now.

<sup>I loved this scene so much. Just two people, simply sharing their time, quietly happy in each other’s presence.</sup>

Outside of that, I dive deep into East Asian media. Anime, K-dramas, J-pop, K-pop. I enjoy them all. Lately, I’ve been especially drawn to Japanese City Pop, with artists like [ANRI](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0xGtOrmB2hnrNRLG3vhpSo), [Tatsuro Yamashita](https://open.spotify.com/artist/41hQ0PoEyj9xEBhwt73aWC), and [S. Kiyotaka & Omega Tribe](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7bG2PIfT22HGxisl6LAohx) on repeat. On the Korean side, I’ve been watching clips from Hospital Playlist (IkSong forever) and listening a lot to [aespa](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6YVMFz59CuY7ngCxTxjpxE), [IVE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6RHTUrRF63xao58xh9FXYJ), and [BOL4](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4k5fFEYgkWYrYvtOK3zVBl). Still, I'm forever a ONCE.
